> With the wisdom of data referencing now in our grasp and Prolog - the ancient
> druidic tongue for setting consent for sharing nature's gifts - in our
> command, the dawn of creation is upon us. It is time to craft portals of
> interaction, intuitive as the forest path, to empower all who wander in our
> digital grove to share and dictate the sacred laws according to the innate
> properties of the metadata. Like ancient druidic symbols carved on stones,
> these user interfaces shall guide and simplify the journey for all seekers of
> knowledge.
